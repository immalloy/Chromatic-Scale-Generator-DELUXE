WHAT THIS APP DOES
This program generates a "fnf chromatic scale" WAV file from your own
samples (short audio recordings). A chromatic scale contains every
note in order (C, C#, D, etc.) over the range you select. 

Each note can be:
- Simply re-used as-is (no pitch shift), OR
- Re-pitched by the program to match exact musical tuning.

The app can also:
- Add automatic markers so FL Studio Slicex and other DAWs can
  recognize each note as a slice.
- Normalize audio volume, apply fades, and fix note lengths.
- Export both a single "chromatic.wav" AND optional individual
  per-note files.

HOW TO USE
1. Launch ChromaticScaleGeneratorDeluxe.exe

2. Choose your SAMPLE FOLDER:
   - Place your WAV files inside a folder.
   - Either name them 1.wav, 2.wav, 3.wav... 
     OR just drop any .wav files there (the app will find them).

3. Select OPTIONS:
   - Start Note / Octave → which note your scale begins on.
   - Range (semitones) → how many notes to generate.
   - Sample Gap (s) → silence between notes in the chromatic.wav.
   - Order → sequential, shuffle, or random sample order.
   - Pitched (retune) → enable exact tuning for each note.
   - Dump individual samples → saves each note as its own file.
   - Peak normalize → makes volumes consistent.
   - Fade (ms) → apply short fade in/out to each note.
   - Fixed note length (s) → pad/trim all notes to same duration.
   - Output sample rate → 48000 Hz or 44100 Hz.

4. Click "Generate".
   - Progress bar will show each note.
   - Final file: chromatic.wav inside your chosen folder.
   - If enabled, a "samples" or "pitched_samples" folder is created.

5. Import into your DAW:
   - Drag chromatic.wav into FL Studio Slicex (markers are already added).
   - Or use the per-note WAVs if you prefer individual files.

TROUBLESHOOTING

[App doesn’t start / crashes immediately]
- Make sure you extracted all files, not just the .exe.
- Update Windows 10/11 and install latest Visual C++ redistributables.

[“No WAV files found in the folder”]
- Ensure your folder has .wav files (16/24-bit PCM, mono or stereo).
- Avoid loading MP3 or other formats.

[Markers not showing in Slicex]
- Verify you used the chromatic.wav generated by this program.
- If your DAW still ignores markers, try the per-note files.

[Notes sound wrong or untuned]
- If “Pitched (retune)” is off, notes are not re-tuned.
- Enable “Pitched” for exact chromatic tuning.
- For very low notes (C0, C1), use longer fixed note lengths.

[App freezes or uses lots of RAM]
- Extremely long source samples + very large range can cause slowdown.
- Use shorter source files or reduce semitone range.
- Uncheck “Dump individual samples” if not needed.

[Windows SmartScreen warning]
- The exe is unsigned, so SmartScreen may ask for confirmation.
- Click “More info” → “Run anyway” to proceed.
